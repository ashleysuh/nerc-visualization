# nerc-visualization


Code I wrote for NREL when working on the NARIS project: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/naris.html Written in Processing. Data has been removed so I can post publicly. 

Visualizes the data as a graph, where each instance is a unique simulation run on the North American power grid system. Users can select a simulation (represented as a timestamp) to view how the power grid system changes. Both nodes and edges have unique attributes that describe energy distribution and loss.
